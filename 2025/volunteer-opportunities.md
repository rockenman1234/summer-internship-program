# Volunteer Opportunities

Many open-source projects look for contributions to their codebase, documentation, or related software. This page collects some details on participating in volunteer opportunities

> [!TIP]
> Please contact the OSPO if you'd like to list your project here as a volunteer (or paid) opportunity!

## General Information and FAQs

### How do I find volunteer opportunities? 

Many open source projects will have a CONTRIBUTING file in the top-level directory that specifies what types of contributions the project accepts. You can also look at the repo's `contribute` page, which may have issues labeled as "Good First Issue". These types of issues are meant to be accessible to new developers with a small amount of initial effort and training. An example of this type of contributing page can be found with the MFC project](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/contribute).

### How much time should I spend as a volunteer?

For summer students working on VSIP volunteer opportunities, we recommend you spend about **5-10** hours a week. Note this is not a hard and fast rule - small contributions are also meaningful to open source projects! However, dedicating this amount of time can allow you to work on a medium to large issues for a project, which can be more meaningful to include on your resume or CV. It also helps to make the best use of your mentor's time, if you are working with a dedicated group of mentors. 

In short, all contributions are meaningful, but please 1) pick issues that match your available time commitment and 2) communicate clearly with the project maintainers with any questions about your contribution.
